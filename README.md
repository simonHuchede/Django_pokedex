# Django

Django is a Python library for dealing with web application development.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install django.

```bash
pip install django
```

## Classic clone method
Before to clone the git project, be sure to be where you should be.
```bash
cd C:/Users/user/my_project
```
Then you can clone the git project while you're in a terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonHuchede/Django_pokedex.git
```

## Virtual environment method
If you prefer to be in a virtual enviroment, then be sure to have virtualenv installed.
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
And then you can create your virtual environment, here we give the name "env" for the virtual repository:
```bash
py -m venv env
```
Then go to:
```bash
cd <env\Scripts>
```
Once there, you'll be able to activate your virtual environment.
```bash
./activate
```
At least, you can clone the git project with the same command in classic method.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonHuchede/Django_pokedex.git
```


# Start your web server
First of all, be sure to be in the project
```bash
cd \Django_pokedex\pokedex_project
```
And then, go to run the web server with this command:
```bash
py manage.py runserver
```
Open a new tab and go to this adress:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Technical choices

We decided to limit the maximum number of pokemons returned in the basic api request from 1151 to 905 because of pokemons not referenced in the api. This request is directly stored in Djangoâ€™s cache to make it easier for the user to navigate.

- To display the characteristics we've chosen a graph via the ChartJs library to make easier the reading for the user.

- We preferred to use Javascript for team management rather than having to create a database to store the user teams, which would have had the impact of having to create an account for the user. We wanted above all to keep a simple way to use the app.
